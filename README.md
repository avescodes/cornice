# Cornice

An experimental library that extracts pedestal-app from
[pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) and exposes it as a
cljx/cljsbuild-enabled library.

**NOTE: I made up the name Cornice. Totally not what it is called.**

## Usage

### REPL

To play with Cornice locally in a REPL run `lein repl`.
(cljsbuild and cljx has been configured to automatically run before tasks such
as this.)

```sh
$ lein repl
# ...
user=>
```
To grok the concepts in Cornice, I suggest following along with the
[walkthrough](doc/walkthrough.clj) at a REPL.

### Install

Install the library locally with the command `lein install`

```sh
$ lein install
Rewriting src/ to target/generated/clj (clj) with features #{clj} and 0 transformations.
Rewriting src/ to target/generated/cljs (cljs) with features #{cljs} and 1 transformations.
Compiling ClojureScript.
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Xmx6144m
Compiling "target/cornice.js" from ["target/generated/cljs"]...
Successfully compiled "target/cornice.js" in 14.496827 seconds.
Created /Users/ryan/Dropbox/code/pedestal/cornice/target/cornice-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Wrote /Users/ryan/Dropbox/code/pedestal/cornice/pom.xml
```

You should now be able to use Cornice (`[io.pedestal/cornice
"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]`) from any Clojure or ClojureScript (cljsbuild) application.


### On cljx

This project uses [cljx](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx) to emit Clojure and
ClojureScript files from a single common source. Files are emitted to
`target/generated/` in their respective folders (`clj` or `cljx`).

To more easily edit `*.cljx` files, follow the [syntax
highlighting](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx#syntax-highlighting) section of
cljx's README.
