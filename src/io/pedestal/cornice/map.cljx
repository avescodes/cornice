(ns io.pedestal.cornice.map
  "Find functions which map an inform message to transform
  messages (hereafter named i->t fns) based on patterns in the event
  entry.

  Transform messages are vectors of one or more transformation entries:

  [[target op other-args] ...]

  Inform messages are vectors of one or more event entries:

  [[source event other-data] ...]

  In the above event entry, source is a path which is the unique id of
  some component in the system; event represents the type of event.

  Source paths are vectors. For example:

  [:a :b :c :d]

  Events are keywords. For example:

  :click, :submit, :added, :removed

  A configuration is provided which maps functions to source/event
  patterns.

  [[function-a [:path1] :*]
   [function-b [:path2] :click]
   [function-c [:path3] :* [:path4] :*]]

  Given a source path and event for an event entry, this map is used
  to find an i->t function.

  A matching path could be an identical path like

  [:a :b :c :d]

  Path patterns may also contain wildcard keywords :* and :**. :*
  matches any path element and :** matches zero or more path elements.

  We could match the path above with the following patterns:

  [:a :b :c :d]
  [:a :b :c :*]
  [:a :* :c :*]
  [:a :* :* :*]
  [:a :**]
  [:**]

  The :* wildcard can be used to match any event.

  An i->t function takes two arguments, the patterns defined in the
  configuration and the inform message that matches these
  patterns. This is not always the best signature for a given i->t
  function so an args-fn can be provided to support any signature."
