  "Path matching.

  Source paths are vectors. For example:

  [:a :b :c :d]

  Message keys are keywords. For example:

  :click, :submit, :added, :removed

  A configuration is provided which maps items to message patterns.

  [[item-a [:path1] :*]
   [item-b [:path2] :click]
   [item-c [:path3] :* [:path4] :*]]

  Given a path and key for a message, this map is used to find
  matching items.

  A matching path could be an identical path like

  [:a :b :c :d]

  Path patterns may also contain wildcard keywords :* and :**. :*
  matches any path element and :** matches zero or more path elements.

  We could match the path above with the following patterns:

  [:a :b :c :d]
  [:a :b :c :*]
  [:a :* :c :*]
  [:a :* :* :*]
  [:a :**]
  [:**]

  The :* wildcard can be used to match any event.")
